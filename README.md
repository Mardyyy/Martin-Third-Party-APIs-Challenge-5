# Martin-Third-Party-APIs-Challenge-5
Module 5 Challenge. Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler.

## Description
This challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day, where it will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Here I was able to learn and apply the material learned this past week about jQuery and third party APIs.
